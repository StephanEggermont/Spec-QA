# QA3 - how to update a tree list keeping current selection?

#Q. I am displaying a tree and I need to add an element, but I want to keep the currently selected item. 
If I do it like this:

```Smalltalk
oldSelectedItem := treePresenter selectedItem.
treePresenter
	roots: newRootCollection;
	selectItem: oldSelectedItem
```
it will of course work, but there is a problem: the activation event (`whenActivatedDo:`) will be triggered and I do not what this!
How can I proceed to avoid it?

#A. 

Trees and Tree tables in spec implement the API `updateRootsKeepingSelection:` to prevent precisely this.  
In practice, it makes the same as the code above, but 

In Spec2, all layouts are dynamic (meaning they can be modified at runtime), but each layout has different API and hence they need to be modified in different ways. In particular, `SpPanedLayout` has just two children: **first** and **second** (they can be displayed vertically -top to bottom- or horizontally -left to right-).
This means that unlike `SpBoxLayout`, in `SpPanedLayout` the use of `#add:` and `#remove:` messages are not necesary and will not always produce the desired result, and since `#add:` will try to add the presenter at the end of the list, in case it succeeds it will always be the second. 
Instead, you can just set the children, and you will be effectively replace the presenter at the place you want.

This code: 

```Smalltalk
treePresenter updateRootsKeepingSelection: newRootCollection
```

Will have the same effect as the original code, but it will not trigger an activation when executed.
(Of course, to work properly is required that the new collection containes the previously selected elements).
