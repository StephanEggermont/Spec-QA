# QA8. Dynamic menus

## Q. How do I get dynamic menus?

## A. 
If your context menu is defined through a block it means is dynamic, and it will be evaluated each time the context menu is invoked.

```
contextMenu: aValuableOrMenuPresenter
    "Set the context menu.
     Context menu can be an instace of `SpMenuPresenter` or a block (that will answer eventually an 
     instance of `SpMenuPresenter` aswell. 
     If your context menu is defined through a block it means is dynamic, and it will be evaluated 
     each time the context menu is invoked."

    contextMenu := aValuableOrMenuPresenter
```

### Example

Look at `SpTreePresenter class>>#exampleWithContextMenu`
